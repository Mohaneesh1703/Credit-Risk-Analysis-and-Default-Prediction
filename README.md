Project Title: Credit Risk Analysis & Default Prediction

📌 Description
This project focuses on analyzing credit risk and predicting loan default using supervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk applicants and improving credit approval decisions.

Using real-world-like financial data, the project includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)

Visual Analytics using Tableau

🚀 Objectives
Identify key factors influencing credit risk (CIBIL score, income, loan amount, etc.)

Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to default

Segment customers based on creditworthiness

Visualize patterns and insights using Tableau dashboards

📂 Components
🧠 Model Training (R Programming)
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Confusion matrix evaluation for both models

📊 Tableau Dashboard (3 Sheets)
Income group vs Default rate analysis

CIBIL Score impact on default

High-risk customer segment profiling

📁 Files Included:
